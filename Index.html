<p> Hi my name is Sam Fishman. I like to scuba dive, and explore the ocean. I haven't been able to Scuba Dive often ever since I started college. Another hobby of mine is cooking. I usually cook food that has a Japanese origin. My focus isn't just on cooking, I also love to bake, and try out new recipes.
</p>
<p> I have been am a member of the fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi since my sophmore year of college. Being in the Fraternity honestly changed my life. I have met many of my best friends through it. Through it I have had many cherishable moments. The experiences that I have had make for great stories.
</p>
